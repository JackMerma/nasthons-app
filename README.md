# Chakrita - Empowering Farmers with Data-Driven Insights

## Project Overview

Chakrita is a mobile application developed by **Nasthoncoders** to assist farmers in managing their crops by providing real-time weather alerts and personalized agricultural advice. Our aim is to help farmers optimize their resources, make better-informed decisions, and protect their crops against climate challenges such as heavy rain, hail, and frost.

### Key Features
- **Weather Alerts**: Notifications for extreme weather events like excessive rain, hailstorms, and frost, ensuring timely actions to protect crops.
- **Personalized Chatbot**: A custom-built assistant to answer farmer's questions regarding crop health, plant diseases, and general agricultural practices.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Chakrita is designed with simplicity in mind, making it accessible even for farmers with limited mobile application experience.

### How It Works
- **Weather Data**: The app integrates real-time weather data to notify users of upcoming extreme weather conditions.
- **Chatbot Support**: Farmers can interact with the chatbot to get expert advice tailored to their specific agricultural needs.
- **Orchard Identification**: Utilizing **LASKDJD** (a plant recognition service), the app identifies the type of plant and orchard characteristics based on the user's location, allowing for quick and easy identification of the orchard.

### Technologies Used
- **PLLaMa Model**: An open-source LLM specialized in plant sciences, trained with over 1.5 million academic articles, providing deep understanding and recommendations for plant biology-related queries.
- **LangChain**: Used for prompt engineering, managing context flows, memory, and information interpretation, allowing Chakrita to maintain a seamless and intuitive interaction with users.
- **RAG and Additional Agents**: We plan to incorporate advanced techniques like **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and other specific agents for handling various tasks related to farming and environmental monitoring.

### Goals
We aim to:
1. Empower farmers with tools to make data-driven, informed decisions.
2. Mitigate the impact of unpredictable weather patterns on crop yields.
3. Promote sustainability in agriculture through the use of advanced technology and real-time data.

### Future Plans
- Expand the app's features to include advanced analytics such as plant disease recognition through photo analysis.
- Provide localized climate analysis to further improve prediction accuracy.
- Integrate the app with IoT devices and drones for continuous data collection and monitoring.
